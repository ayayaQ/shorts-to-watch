# shorts-to-watch
A very simple Chrome extension to redirect from a YouTube Shorts page to a regular video watch page. This works well if you prefer to be able to use controls found in a regular video, but not found in the very limited Shorts page video.

## Install
- Make sure you have developer mode enabled for extensions.
- Load the unpacked folder "shorts-to-watch" found in this repository.
