# Archived
This was made in a time where the user experience on shorts was lacking. In the present time, shorts has added the various missing features that made it so frustrating to use without. In turn, this repo has fallen out of maintenance and does not function anymore.

# shorts-to-watch
A very simple Chrome extension to redirect from a YouTube Shorts page to a regular video watch page. This works well if you prefer to be able to use controls found in a regular video, but not found in the very limited Shorts page video.

## Install
- Make sure you have developer mode enabled for extensions.
- Load the unpacked folder "shorts-to-watch" found in this repository.
